# File Fetch Flow (Bridge + gittr UI)

This page documents how the git-nostr-bridge fits into gittr’s file fetching pipeline so other
clients can reproduce the same behavior.

## 1. What the bridge already exposes

- **Repository mirror**: when a NIP-34 event hits the relays (or `/api/event` via `BRIDGE_HTTP_PORT`),
  the bridge clones/updates the bare repo under `repositoryDir`.
- **File tree API**: once cloned, a GET on `http://<bridge>/api/nostr/repo/tree?repo=<pk>/<name>` returns
  a flat file list (used for directory views).
- **File content API**: GET `.../api/nostr/repo/file-content?repo=<pk>/<name>&path=<file>&branch=<ref>`
  streams blob contents.
- **Clone trigger**: if the repo is missing, gittr asks `.../api/nostr/repo/clone` and the bridge pulls
  it from the `clone`/`source` tags in the NIP-34 event, then broadcasts a `grasp-repo-cloned` SSE for
  auto-refresh.

## 2. UI flow recap (gittr)

1. **User opens a repo tab** (files, issues, PRs, commits, etc.).
2. UI tries cached data → embedded NIP-34 files → bridge tree API.
3. If bridge returns 404, gittr triggers `repo/clone`, waits ~3 seconds, retries tree API.
4. If still missing, UI falls back to GitHub/GitLab/Codeberg APIs using the normalized `source` URLs.
5. File open actions follow the same order: cache → embedded content → bridge → external hosts.

This is described in detail in gittr’s `docs/FILE_FETCHING_INSIGHTS.md`, but the bridge only needs to
provide step 2/3 above.

## 3. What’s “new” in this fork

- **HTTP fast lane** (`BRIDGE_HTTP_PORT`): lets the UI POST a signed NIP-34 event straight to the
  bridge so the repo is mirrored immediately instead of waiting for relay propagation.
- **Deduplication channel**: ensures the same event coming from both HTTP and relays doesn’t clone
  twice.
- **Watch-all mode**: leaving `gitRepoOwners` empty mirrors *every* repo, which is how gittr builds
  the public “Browse” list.

## 4. How other clients can reuse it

- Publish regular gitnostr events (kinds 50, 51, 30617) and the bridge will mirror them exactly as
  gittr does.
- Use the tree and file-content endpoints for any UI (web, CLI) that needs file browsing without
  cloning locally.
- If you want instant confirmation after publishing, enable the HTTP API via `BRIDGE_HTTP_PORT` and
  POST the same event JSON you sent to relays.
- For GRASP-compatible flows, listen for the `grasp-repo-cloned` event (SSE) after calling the clone
  API to know when the repo is ready.

With these pieces, any frontend can implement the same file list/content fallbacks shown in gittr’s
docs, while the bridge remains host-agnostic.
